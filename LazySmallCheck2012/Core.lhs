Quantification contexts
-----------------------

The quantification context is simply a (co)monad container that
carries information about quantifiers.

> type QuantInfo = [AlignedString]
>
> data QuantCtx a = QC { qcCtx :: QuantInfo, qcVal :: a }
>
> instance Functor QuantCtx where
>   fmap f (QC ctx val) = QC ctx (f val)
>
> instance Applicative QuantCtx where
>   pure = QC []
>   QC ctx0 f <*> QC ctx1 x = QC (ctx0 ++ ctx1) (f x)

QuantInfo simply holds the pretty-printed representations of
instantiated quantification variable values.

> data AlignedString = LAlign [AlignedString]
>                    | Append String AlignedString
>                    | Braces [AlignedString]
>
> string = (`Append` LAlign [])
>
> showDoc n (LAlign []) = ""
> showDoc n (LAlign (x:xs))
>   = init (unlines (showDoc n x : map ((replicate n ' ' ++) . showDoc 0) xs))
> showDoc n (Append str astr) = str ++ showDoc (n + length str) astr
> showDoc n (Braces []) = "{ }"
> showDoc n (Braces (x:xs)) 
>   = "{ " ++ init (unlines (showDoc (n + 2) x : map (((replicate n ' ' ++ "; ") ++) . showDoc 0) xs)) ++ " }"
>
> instance Show AlignedString where
>   show     = showDoc 0
>   showList = shows . LAlign . zipWith (\i -> Append ("Var " ++ show i ++ ": ")) [0..]

Test data terms
---------------

A `Term` is a pairing of possibly partial values with their possible
expansions. The `tValue` component takes in a root path values and
returns a possibly `Partial` value (containing exceptions of type
`LSC`), wrapping in a quantification context (`QuantCtx`) holding
pretty-printed representations of instantiated quantification
variables. The `tExpand` component returns a list of Terms that are
expansions at the path provided.

> type DLocation = (Nesting, Path -> Path)
>
> data Term a = PTerm { ptValue  :: DLocation -> QuantCtx (Partial LSC a)
>                     , ptExpand :: Path      -> [Term a]
>                     , ptSize   :: !Integer }
>             | TTerm   { ttValue :: QuantCtx a }
>
> tValue :: Term a -> DLocation -> QuantCtx (Partial LSC a)
> tValue (TTerm v)   = pure $ fmap pure v
> tValue (PTerm v _ _) = v
>
> tExpand :: Term a -> Path -> [Term a]
> tExpand (TTerm _)    = pure []
> tExpand (PTerm _ es _) = es
>
> tSize :: Term a -> Integer
> tSize (TTerm _)     = 1
> tSize (PTerm _ _ n) = n
>
> instance Functor Term where
>   fmap f (TTerm v)      = TTerm (fmap f v)
>   fmap f (PTerm v es n) = PTerm (fmap3 f v) (fmap3 f es) n
>
> instance Applicative Term where
>   pure = TTerm . pure
>   TTerm f <*> TTerm x = TTerm (f <*> x)
>   fs      <*> xs      = PTerm
>     (\(n, ps) -> (<*>) <$> tValue fs (n, ps . (False:))
>                        <*> tValue xs (n, ps . (True:)))
>     (\(p:ps)  -> if p then fmap (fs <*>) (tExpand xs ps)
>                       else fmap (<*> xs) (tExpand fs ps))
>     (tSize fs * tSize xs)


Series and Serial generators
----------------------------

Generators of Lazy SmallCheck values are defined by the `Series`
functor. Instances of `Functor`, `Applicative` and `Alternative` are
provided such that the depth-bounding and partiality functionality is
introduced and preserved.

> type Depth = Int
>
> -- | A depth-bounded generator of type `a`.
> newtype Series a = Series { runSeries :: Depth -> [Term a] }
>
> instance Functor Series where
>   fmap f xs = pure f <*> xs
>
> instance Applicative Series where
>   pure = Series . pure3
>   Series fs <*> Series xs = Series $ \d ->
>     [ f <*> mergeTerms x | d > 0, f <- fs d
>                          , let x = xs (d - 1), (not.null) x ]
>
> mergeTerms :: [Term a] -> Term a
> mergeTerms []  = error "LSC: Cannot merge empty terms."
> mergeTerms [x] = x
> mergeTerms xs  = PTerm (QC [string "_"] . inject . Expand . second ($ [])) (const xs) (sum $ map tSize xs)
>
> instance Alternative Series where
>   empty = Series $ pure []
>   Series xs <|> Series ys = Series $ (++) <$> xs <*> ys

Using this interface, we can define series generators for types. For
example, a series generator for Peano numerals could be represented as;

< peanoSeries :: Series Peano
< peanoSeries = pure Zero <|> (pure Succ <âˆ—> peanoSeries)

When instantiating quantification variables, the QuantInfo
representation is stored. The instantiation is performed
automatically for types satisfying the Serial type-class.

> -- | The depth-bounded generator of type 'a'.
> class (Data a, Typeable a, Show a) => Serial a where
>   -- | Return the 'Series' for this type.
>   series :: Series a
>
>   -- | Return the 'Series' for this type, storing the pretty-printed
>   -- value in the quantification context.
>   seriesWithCtx :: Series a
>   seriesWithCtx = Series $ (fmap . fmap) storeShow $ runSeries series
>     where storeShow (TTerm v) = TTerm
>             ((\(QC _ x) -> QC [string $ show x] x) v)
>           storeShow (PTerm v es n) = PTerm 
>             ((fmap $ \(QC _ x) -> QC [string $ show x] x) v)
>             ((fmap . fmap) storeShow es) n

The `storeShow` value uses the Partial instance of `Show` to store a
pretty-printed representation of each `Term`'s value in its
quantification context. Now that we have the Serial type-class,
the `cons<N>` family of combinators can be constructed as described by
Runciman et al. (2008).

> cons, cons0 :: o -> Series o
> cons  = pure
> cons0 = pure
>
> cons1 :: Serial a => 
>          (a -> o) -> Series o
> cons1 f = f <$> series
>
> cons2 :: (Serial a, Serial b) => 
>          (a -> b -> o) -> Series o
> cons2 f = f <$> series <*> series
>
> cons3 :: (Serial a, Serial b, Serial c) => 
>          (a -> b -> c -> o) -> Series o
> cons3 f = f <$> series <*> series <*> series
>
> cons4 :: (Serial a, Serial b, Serial c, Serial d) => 
>          (a -> b -> c -> d -> o) -> Series o
> cons4 f = f <$> series <*> series <*> series <*> series
>
> cons5 :: (Serial a, Serial b, Serial c, Serial d, Serial e) => 
>          (a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> o) -> Series o
> cons5 f = f <$> series <*> series <*> series <*> series <*> series
>
> -- | Series union. Synonym for '<|>'.
> (\/) :: Series a -> Series a -> Series a
> (\/) = (<|>)
>
> -- | Series application. Synonym for '<*>'.
> (><) :: Series (a -> b) -> Series a -> Series b
> (><) = (<*>)
>
> -- | Adjust the depth of a series by pre-composing a depth function.
> deeperBy :: (Int -> Int) -> Series a -> Series a
> deeperBy f xs = Series $ \d -> runSeries xs (f d)
>
> -- | Offset the depth cost of an application.
> zeroCost :: Series a -> Series a
> zeroCost = deeperBy (+1)
>
> -- | Zero-cost Series application.
> applZC :: Series (a -> b) -> Series a -> Series b
> applZC (Series fs) (Series xs) = Series $ \d ->

Refute
------

The `Counter` comonad holds the number of tests performed.

> data Counter c a = C { ctrTests :: !c, ctrValue :: !a }
> 
> instance Functor (Counter c) where
>   fmap f (C ct v) = C ct (f v)
>
> instance Monoid c => Applicative (Counter c) where
>   pure = C mempty
>   C fct fv <*> C xct xv = C (fct `mappend` xct) (fv xv)
>
> instance (NFData c, NFData a) => NFData (Counter c a) where
>   rnf (C ct x) = rnf ct `seq` rnf x 

A function that searches for `counterexample`s assuming no higher
level quantification.

> counterexample d xs = either (error "LSC: Unresolved expansion") id 
>                       `fmap` refute 0 d xs

The algorithm for refuting properties (finding counterexamples) is
defined using using auxiliary functions, making use of the Partial
values library. At various points, exceptions are made explicit
through the `runPartial` function.
